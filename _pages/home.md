  Forklift Battery Pack Optimization
---
# What is PzFORK?
One of the most important issues for traction battery manufacturers and their users is the optimized sorting and arrangement of the battery container in forklifts. Choosing the optimized arrangement is a time-consuming process and sometimes, results will be in an inefficient array. **PzFORK** is a software package that suggests the optimized layout of traction battery container in various sizes, voltages, and capacities. Based on the user’s need, the priority of the suggestions is determined in order of the maximum battery capacity with the largest occupied area and volume of the container. **PzFORK** database supports 13 brands of the most popular battery manufacturers around the world such as; SUNLIGHT, MIDAC, FAAM, HAWKER, GNB EXIDE, GS YUASA, BAE BERLIN, HOPPECKE, ZIBO TORCH, TIANNENG, EVEREXCEED, CNBATTE, and SABA in two international battery standards (DIN and BS) PzS and PzB models. The export file includes a 2D technical plan of the battery container in two views (top and side) what is also, mentioned the specific characterization of the container and battery.
